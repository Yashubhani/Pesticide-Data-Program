Recently, increased attention has been focused on chemical residues in food. The presence of minute residues of pesticides in food has caused some people to ask, “Is our food supply safe?” 

The above statement motivated my choice of dataset for this project which has been extracted from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) that conducts the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) every year. I have used Tableau to arrive at some interesting findings regarding pesticide residues and created visualizations that reflected the insights for better judgement.
