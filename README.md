Recently, increased attention has been focused on chemical residues in food. The presence of minute residues of pesticides in food has caused some people to ask, “Is our food supply safe?” 

Current evidence strongly indicates that our food is safe. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials recently stated that “pesticide residues occurring in foods in the U.S. pose a very minor if not negligible risk to public health.” However, public perceptions of risks from pesticides differ markedly from this official viewpoint. They also differ from actual risks attributable to these products. A 1982 study compared the causes of accidental deaths, as reported to insurance companies, with the risks as perceived by college students, women voters, and business people. College students ranked pesticides as more dangerous than motorcycle riding; women voters ranked pesticides as more dangerous than hunting; and business people felt they were more dangerous than commercial aviation. The actual rankings of these in relation to all causes of accidental deaths were as follows: motorcycles (6th), hunting (14th), commercial aviation (19th), and pesticides (28th).
